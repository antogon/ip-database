		We will need to decide whether we will be using

	<h2>Statistics</h2>
	<p>
		Current key statistics will be viewable from

	</p>
	<p>
		We need to ask what comprises key statistics.
		We could probably decide on our own, but I would
		much rather hear from the client what they view as
		being the most important bits of information to see
		when they only have a moment to glance at the site.
		We could even ask what sort of statitistics are good
		and what are bad so that we could take advantage of
		Bootstrap's "Alerts" component.

	<h2>Recent Changes</h2>
		A log of the most recent changes will be
